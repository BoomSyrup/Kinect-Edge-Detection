# Kinect-Edge-Detection

This project was designed to:

* 1) Take in depth map from the Microsoft Kinect 

* 2) Convert the depth map into a point cloud

* 3) From the point cloud, find significant edges that bound geometry which would impede navigation for a self-navigating robot  

## Dependencies:

* numpy
* Cython
* freenect
* vispy (for visualization of data)
